Open X Library: Multiple Purpose C Open Engine

OpenXL is a multiple purpose c open engine. A proceduralization library. It can be seen as the artist, the designer, even the programmer of your project. It is designed so it has some function power that could turn into any task, performing a texture, a pixel art image, a mesh, a model, a level, a song, etc, ... The idea is to take the part of the missing components on your team.

$ git clone http://code.google.com/p/openxl
$ cd xl
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(pwd)/tools/pkgconfig"
$ make
# make install
